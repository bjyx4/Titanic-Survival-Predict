# Titanic-Survival-Predict
kaggle competition -- Titanic

Score 0.77033

I have compared several models when making predictions, inducluding LogisticRegression,RandomForestClassifier and GradientBoostingClassifier models. I finally choose Logistic Regression model to predict the survival on the Titanic, because it presents the best results on the dataset.
